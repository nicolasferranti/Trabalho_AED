# Trabalho_AED

Project created as part of the algorithms and data structure course taken during my master's degree at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora.
The project consists of an in-memory database using different data structures to store and retrieve data efficiently. 
Search operations using the register ID and joins based on columns were also implemented.
